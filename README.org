* Recitations

** Recitation 8
[[file:notes/Recitation8.pdf][Here]].

In this recitation I:
1. Introduced (stochastic) order notation, which can be useful to simplify
   proofs about asymptotics later on
2. Reviewed the basic asymptotic machinery: CMT, Slutzky's theorem, Delta
   method. 

   I didn't focus on the proofs but some of them can be found in [[file:other_notes/N04_asymptotic_order.pdf][these notes]].
3. Talked about OLS asymptotics under different sets of assumptions. There
   was no time to cover this in much detail so I strongly suggest you
   should read BH chapter 7
