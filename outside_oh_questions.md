## Why<a id="sec-1-1"></a>

The ideal time to ask questions about the material and problem sets is during office hours. However, many of you can't make it to office hours for valid reasons, so I also generally questions sent by e-mail or other means.

Keeping this document helps you (and yours truly) for a few reasons:

-   More clarifications/explanations available
-   There is no \`unfair advantage' to those who ask many questions
-   I don't have to answer the same thing over and over :)
