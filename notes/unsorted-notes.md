-   <span class="underline">Finite additivity</span>
    
    Let's define some notation. For an indexed collection of sets \(A_i\) I can define \[A_1 + A_2 := A_1 \cup A_2\] or, more generally \[ \sum_i A_i := \bigcup_i A_i \] whenever the collection \(A_i\) is pairwise disjoint.
    
    The idea of assuming additivity &#x2013; without much further qualification &#x2013; is that set-function \(\mathbf P\) satisfies some form of linearity, that is \[ \mathbf P\left( \sum A_i \right) = \sum_i \mathbf P \left( A_i \right) \] It turns out that the set of indices over which this assumption is made is consequential.
    
    We call \(\mathbf P\) *finitely additive* if the above is required to hold for all finite sets of indices. Similarly, if the relationship holds for countably many indices, \(\mathbf P\) is called *countably additive*.
    
    Let's investigate an example of additive measure. Here, we are working with a triple \((X, \mathcal A, \mathbf P)\). \(\mathcal A\) is an *algebra* of sets. Very similar to the usual \(\sigma-\text{algebra}\) couterpart, but we don't require the assumptions of closedness under unions and intersections to hold for infinitely many collections.
